    # This scary query does the following
    # * Figures out the unique price points (price+volume) and their first and 
    #   last date of sale based on order_items
    # * Counts the total number of unique price points sold per sku
    # * Creates a set of all price points based on order_items and skus, with
    #   current being calculated.
    # * Determines the valid_from and valid_to based on current status and the
    #   overlap between first sale and last sale date for each price point.
